<h1>Calendar Background</h1>
<p>Around 1999 I adopted a very unusual hobby: calendar design. After joining the Mars Society while
  living in the Netherlands, I met a brilliant architect named Frans Blok, who has produced a
  fascinating website (the <a
    href="http://www.geocities.com/fra_nl/" target="_blank">Darian Defrost Calendar</a>) that
  combines terraforming (an interest of mine) with a well-known Mars calendar. His concept is based
  on the <a class='wiki'
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darian_calendar"
    target="_blank">Darian Calendar</a>, probably the best known calendar for Mars, which was
  designed by world expert on martian time-keeping systems and creator of the <a
    href="http://www.martiana.org/mars" target="_blank">Martian Time Website</a>, Thomas Gangale, in
  1985.</p>
<p>The idea of calendar design appealed to me, combining as it does elements of maths, computing,
  astronomy, psychology, history, religion, mythology and design. For a while I enjoyed creating my
  own Mars calendar, called the Keplerian Calendar. (Hopefully this will one day be online
  again.)</p>
<p>While playing with martian calendars I studied many different calendars for Earth, some that are
  being used now, some that had been used in the past, and others that have been proposed as
  improvements. This inevitably got me thinking about what an optimal Earth calendar would look
  like, a notion that percolated in my mind for about 7 years. For most of this time I believed the
  best calendar for Earth would be lunisolar, but eventually I accepted that a solar calendar is
  better, and finally settled on the design described at this website.</p>

<h2><strong>About </strong>me</h2>
<p>I'm a 36-year-old web programmer and space enthusiast currently living in Melbourne, Australia.
  Although I was born in Melbourne, I've lived most of my life in sunny Queensland, except for a few
  years in Europe where I lived and worked in the Netherlands, Ireland and the UK.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, and have taken postgraduate
  courses in Information Systems Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering. For the past 20 years
  I've worked primarily as a computer programmer, but also a computer technician, door-to-door
  salesperson, manager, teacher, design draftsperson and post-hole digger.</p>
<p>My main interest is space colonisation, and I'm a member of the <a
    href='http://www.marssociety.org' target="_blank">Mars Society</a>, the <a
    href='http://www.marshome.org' target="_blank">Mars Foundation</a>, the <a
    href='http://www.moonsociety.org' target='_blank'>Moon Society</a>, the <a
    href='http://www.space-frontier.org/' target="_blank">Space Frontier Foundation</a> and the <a
    href='http://www.nssa.com.au' target="_blank">National Space Society of Australia</a>. I've
  written <a
    href="http://shaunmoss.id.au/mars.php" target="_blank">two scientific papers about Mars</a>:
  <em>Terraforming Mars</em> and <em>Steelmaking on Mars</em>, which I presented at the
  International Mars Society Convention in Washington D.C. in 2006. These will appear in <em>On To
    Mars 3</em>, due out in 2009.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years I have also become interested in the environment, a field I
  perceive as being strongly related to space colonisation. The similarities between ecovillages and
  space settlements led to the development of the <a href="http://ascensiontek.com" target="_blank">AscensionTek</a>
  business concept. I enjoy designing human settlements, one of my favourite ideas being an
  ambitious research facility in Antarctica called the <a
    href="http://shaunmoss.id.au/articles/ICE.php" target="_blank">Institute for Colonisation and
    Exploration</a> (ICE). My interest in planetary engineering led to the idea for the <a
    href="http://shaunmoss.id.au/blog/2008/08/global-tree-planting-program/"
    target="_blank">Global Tree-Planting Program</a>.</p>
<p>My main goal in life is to start my own global mega-corporation dedicated to technology
  development and space colonisation. Either that, or make amusing science fiction movies, since
  no-one else seems to want to or knows how. I am also trying to be a writer. It is my belief that
  the space colonisation movement will ultimately result in total environmental, emotional and
  economic healing of Earth, abundant supplies of food, water and other resources for everyone on
  our planet, the development of a benevolent world government, and peace, freedom and stable
  operating systems for all.</p>
