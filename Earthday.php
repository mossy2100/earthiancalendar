<h1> Earthdays</h1>
<p>Earthdays are allocated as global holidays dedicated to our planet, planting trees and caring for plants, animals and people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Name for the 8th Day of the Week</h2>
<p>The idea for introducing 8-day weeks to create a perpetual calendar came before the concept of Earthday.</p>
<p>Having this extra day meant that it required a name. Following the pattern of the Persian astrologers who originally named the days of the week after the 7 wandering celestial bodies visible to the naked eye, the next logical member of the sequence would probably have been either Ceres or Uranus. Although Ceres is not strictly a planet (it's a dwarf planet according to the most recent definitions), it can occasionally be seen with the naked eye, if the conditions are ideal. Uranus cannot be seen with the naked eye from Earth, however it is the next planet out from the Sun after Saturn.</p>
<p>However, this calendar is designed for a space-faring civilization, and is intended for use on space stations and space vehicles. From that perspective, Earth is also a highly visible planet. This led to the 8th day being called Earthday. Alternative names considered were Terraday or Gaiaday, but &quot;Earthday&quot; seems much more fitting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Purpose of Earthday</h2>
<p>The notion of an extra day for 5 out of every 8 weeks seemed to raise the question of its purpose. It is not the intent that this be a work day, in fact, part of the problem on Earth is that people spend too much time working and not enough time playing, expressing themselves, resting, spending time with their families, exploring, taking care of the planet, having fun, etc. This is supposed to be a somewhat advanced culture, but there are people in the world still working as hard and as long as 18th-century coal-miners. Life is not meant to be about work, it is meant to be about happiness.</p>
<p>Having an extra day most weekends gives us that extra time we need to recover from a week at work, and to do other things that we may be missing out on.</p>
<p>However, there is something important that we could use this day for, which is to help our planet. By helping Earth, we help ourselves, because Earth provides all our food, water, materials and everything else we need to live.</p>
<p>Earth is a living being, and she is currently very sick.</p>
<p>I'm not just talking about global warming, the current hot topic. There are other problems, major problems. The biggest of all is that hundreds of thousands of people are starving to death right now. It is only a small fraction of the humans on Earth that live in relative luxury, sitting on a comfortable chair at our desk, relaxing and reading a website. The biggest problem many of us will face today is the coffee-machine breaking down. It's easy for us lucky ones to think that the whole world lives like us, but this is not the case. 16,000 children will die today from hunger. That's just <em>children</em>.</p>
<p>Another major problem that we have on Earth is pollution. Pollution is affecting everyone. Thousands of species are dying out because their environments have become toxic. Our own food supplies have become polluted through the tonnes of pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals and other toxins released into the environment every year. A related issue is deforestation, because a healthy tree population greatly improves water, air and soil quality, provides food and shelter for millions of animals, and sequestrate carbon from the atmosphere, thus solving global warming. Yet we remove thousands of hectares of life-giving forest from the face of the planet every year.</p>
<p>Most of us are so embroiled in our personal problems, and are spending so much time at work, that it is hard to do anything about these things. It's not necessarily anyone's fault - it's just nature. The tendency of nature is to continue along the path of least resistance until it becomes impractical to do so - then it finds another way.</p>
<p>At the moment the path of least resistance is just to keep on doing what we're doing. But the status quo is not sustainable and is definitely coming to an end, possibly a painful one. And then, being ingenious creatures, we will find another way. But in the meantime, maybe we can prepare. Maybe there are some things we can do to make things easier during the upcoming transition.</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas for Earthday activities.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Plant a tree.</li>
  <li>Feed a homeless person or give them a blanket.</li>
  <li>Write a letter to your local government representative.</li>
  <li>Sponsor a child.</li>
  <li>Give someone a hug.</li>
  <li>Say something nice to someone; tell them you appreciate them.</li>
  <li>Install solar panels.</li>
  <li>Install a water tank.</li>
  <li>Plant an organic garden in your backyard.</li>
  <li>Pray for world peace.</li>
</ol>
<p>Earthday is a whole extra day off. All you have to do is one thing to make the world a better place. Love is the answer - it's the only answer there ever was.</p>
